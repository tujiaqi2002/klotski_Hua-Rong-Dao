# klotski_Hua-Rong-Dao
So the reason why I made this project is very simple and easy. I had a course called CSC384 and our first project is about making an AI solver using DFS and A* algorithms to solve a Klotski or Hua-Rong-Dao(华容道) game using python. While I was working on this project, I can’t even find a good tool or web which can let me play this game online, so after I finish my assignment, I decided this make a web version of this game. So in the future, might, a lower grade U of T student or more can use this website to test their assessment. Or just for most people to have fun.
